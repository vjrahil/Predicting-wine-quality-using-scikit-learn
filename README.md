# Predicting-wine-quality-using-scikit-learn
Builded a model which will help in classifying the wines with different composition to different genre of people.Project  help you master the workflow of model building.

# Accuracies for different models
Accuracies based on different classifier were found out to be:
1 - Naive_bayes = 96.14% <br />
2 - KNN = 97.73% <br />
3 - SVM(rbf) = 96.30% <br />
4 - SVM(linear) = 97.74% <br />
5 - Decision Tree = 93.33% <br />
6 - RandomForest = 93.07% <br />
7 - Logistic Regression = 97.14% <br />

-->Accuracies were taken out by testing each classifier 5 times on dataset and taking the average of it. <br />
-->Best Classifier for this dataset is ---> SVM(Linear). <br />
-->After applying grid search on svm(linear) classifier we get accuracy = 97.74% /<br />
-->For dimensionality reduction I have used principle component analysis algorithm(Just for pictorial representation of different classifiers in 2-D for better understanding).
